Agenda

Finish demo week 6  
- Bypass authentication for this demo maybe. Instead create hardcoded demo user.
Anoek will work with Elliot and Rico if possible to try to make it work though.  
- Decide on if we should call what we return to the user CO2 saved or score.  
- Plan working together on finishing the parts we still need implemented for the demo.

Thing to do
- Connecting registering and logging to the database
- Make api call that returns score/CO2 saved
