**4. Announcements: **
Ioanna has an idea how to work efficiently on the general idea of the project  
Paperwork is important and we were late (maybe) so let's do it on Saturday  
Please be very clear about what you are working and try not to do double work  

Ioanna wants Anoek to work on calculator and score with Rico's help  
Anoek is going to finish authorisation first  

**5. Action items ** 

*Eliott:* design and implement database  

*Rico:* make the client and server communicate to perform necessary actions  

*Anoek:* still working on Authentication  

*Paula:* vegimeal plus extra features  

*Ioanna:* work on the GUI and JSON requests  

   - What did we do last week/weekend?  

  Paula & Ioanna beautified her homescreen and worked on menu  
  Anoek created JWT - invalid credentials, testing and vaild credentials still need to be implemented  
  Eliott working on testing database  
  Rico cleaned up code, improved tests, worked client server communication  

 
Joanna says we need user-score and user-relationship now. If we don't track the life of the user, we are more responsible.  
Eliott says we should use an actionlog.  

**New action items:  **
*Everyone:* sprint review, checkstyle, tags and code coverage (Saturday)  
*Everyone:* finish the demo by the end of the week  
*Everyone who took notes:* uploads items onto issue board (Tuesday)

**6. Agenda items** 

    - Issues  
    - Problems with ongoing work? Anyone stuck? How can we fix the problem?  
	No one is stuck at the moment :)  
   - Discuss with the TA about:  
		- How to implement CO2 consumption calculator  
			We can hardcode, but TA will send link to webAPI (not easy)  
			TAs don't care about how the calculator is implemented as much  
			Paula says we can do intervals(time/distance) on every feature  
			Calculation on client or serverside?  
			Rico: server, because it's more maintainable  

   		- Lower approvals needed for merge request  
			Will be lowered  
  
   		- Add code coverage tool to gitlab  
			TA will look into it  

		- Run checkstyle & code coverage on develop branch since friday and onward  
			Only have to do it with what the TA has to see  
			Still do it for good practice   
			Your own brances don't have to have any coverage but make sure you know how much they cover  

   - Discuss implementations/extra features   
	Paula want to implement an extra feature with colours/dark theme-white theme  

   - One friend vs multiple friends  
	Eliott: one friend would be easier to implement  
	Anoek: act as if all friends are one friend  
	Ask: TAs how to exactly implement gamification (1 friend, multiple friends, no friends)  
		TA: 1 friend is fine, don't use no friends (easier)  
		We are using 1 friend for now
