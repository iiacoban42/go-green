# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Too much focus on Demo
Next time we will focus more on specifying and dividing tasks better.

### Problem 2: Database testing
If there is a try catch method, the catch branch is difficult to test. We will be testing that more on the upcoming week.

## Adjustments from previous sprints  
 - Better communication
 - Productivity
 - Organization

## Adjustments for next sprint  
- Divide our to-do's better
