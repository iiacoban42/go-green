Strong points:
- Orgazination and planning skills
- Motivation
>>>>>>> README.md

Weak points:
- I don't have prior knownledge of programming

My goal for this project is not only to be a better programmer, but to be a better computer scientist. Aiming to be responsible for my ideas and respectful of others'. My reality starts from very poor backgroud in progrommaning but I am motivated to be the best version of me in relation to the project and my teammates. I strongly believe that working with people with different mindset and backgrounds will be an incredible opportunity to achieve my, and hopefully, everyone's goal. I am willing to listen and pay attention to make sure I learn everything I can.

Strong Points
•	Responsible 
•	Quick Learner 
•	Able to adapt to different situations 

Weak Points
•	Selfish
•	Impatient

What I would like to gain from that project and set as a personal goal is first of all to learn to work efficiently in a team.
It’s generally not always easy to cooperate and communicate with people in order to keep a project in track. It needs from all
the members to be responsible,patient,organized and of course ready to help each other.Furthermore, I would like to become a 
better programmer and improve my skills in software engineering. I see the project as a great opportunity to learn as much as
possible about java and the other programs we need to work with.During this project i would like to learn more about testing,
how to test efficiently and what does it mean to be a responsible programmer.I believe that in order to complete the project 
each one of us will have to work on their teamwork and programming skills.

Develop a goal:
+ I think I can either lead a team or follow depending on what a team needs.
+ I am a hard worker and I am willing to put the time in to reach my goal.
- I tend to fall too much back in helping develop the project if it seems 
like other people are much better in whatever we are trying to achieve than me.
- Sometimes I get too absorbed into a project and time spend on other projects become less and less as
I become more invested in the one project.

Create plan to achieve your goal:
I hope I will be able to learn a lot about programming java in this group. I'm really excited
to learn from others and their experiences. I hope git will also be less of a mystery to me at the end of the
project.
This is important to me because I think it's part of CSE's core to program well and willingness to learn 
from others. Git is not that important to me personally, but I think it would make things easier.
For programming java and learning from others, the goal is never really reached since technology will keep
on developing. For git I think at the end of the project I probably will understand it well enough to serve me.

I like to think I am actively working on this goal? It should be since I am actively doing the group work
and am excited for the project. You can always do more, but there is also a limit to your time and
energy. Both of those should also go into the other courses. I could try harder but I'm actually pretty 
comfortable with the amount of time and energy put into learning how to program.

Currently I'm just using the project as a crutch to grow further. I can use stackoverflow and teammates 
to learn more. I'm also very excited to learn more ways to improve my programming. The only thing in my way 
is practice and time.
