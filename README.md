Strong points:
- Orgazination and planning skills
- Motivation

Weak points:
- I don't have prior knownledge of programming

My goal for this project is not only to be a better programmer, but to be a better computer scientist. Aiming to be responsible for my ideas and respectful of others'. My reality starts from very poor backgroud in progrommaning but I am motivated to be the best version of me in relation to the project and my teammates. I strongly believe that working with people with different mindset and backgrounds will be an incredible opportunity to achieve my, and hopefully, everyone's goal. I am willing to listen and pay attention to make sure I learn everything I can.
