Strong Points

Weak Points
•	Selfish
•	Impatient

What I would like to gain from that project and set as a personal goal is first of all to learn to work efficiently in a team.
It’s generally not always easy to cooperate and communicate with people in order to keep a project in track. It needs from all
the members to be responsible,patient,organized and of course ready to help each other.Furthermore, I would like to become a 
better programmer and improve my skills in software engineering. I see the project as a great opportunity to learn as much as
possible about java and the other programs we need to work with.During this project i would like to learn more about testing,
how to test efficiently and what does it mean to be a responsible programmer.I believe that in order to complete the project 
each one of us will have to work on their teamwork and programming skills.
