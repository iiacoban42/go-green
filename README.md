# GOGREEN  

GoGreen is a gamified app that tracks the CO2 saved by the environment-friendly activities of the user and shared the score with a friend. 
We try to encourage everybody who uses this app to adopt a mindful attitude towards the nature as well as a healthier lifestyle. The actions tracked are 
eating a vegetarian meal, buying local products, taking the bike or public transportation instead of car, installing solar panels and lower the home temperature. 
You can find these activities on the home page. The CO2 saved page shows the amount of CO2 you saved so far and on the oponent page you can find the CO2 saved by the friend you are competing with.
